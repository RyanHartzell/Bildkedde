# Bildkedde
An extensible imaging system simulation library utilizing an MTF and image chain approach.

# Roadmap

1) Basic algorithms and classes with routines in numpy/scipy for spatial/time<->frequency domain transforms on the fly 
2) Dedicated Image or Array object for describing slices of any step of the optical imaging chain at any point during processing
3) Actual sensor model objects (both high-level for beginners + API simplicity, and low-level for flexibility - including some factories and 'class converter' decorators!!!)
4) Providing some sort of linking structure (networkx or possibly utilizing IP)
5) Improvements to the API + simplifying common routines to single callables
***6) LISTED LAST, BUT MOST IMPORTANT: Integrate sensor model standards from other fields and work on white paper + documentation describing and citing process IN DETAIL
